            <h2>Changes that has been made</h2>
            <hr>
            <h2>Fonts</h2>
            <p>The fonts we had chosen initially brought up some compatibility concern and we opted to change the fonts as well as include fallback fonts. For the header as well as the navbar fonts we had initially chosen Tajawal but ended up using Trebuchet MS. 
                For the paragraphs we had initially planned to use lora. Where lora is supported it will be used. but in most cases Times New Roman will be the paragraph font.</p>
            <h2>Width of body</h2>
            <p>The body width was originally specified to be 900px. But as we found some pages to be a little cramped with only 900px width we made the decision, with readability and ease of use in mind, to make use of the screen space and set the width to 75% of screen width. With a width of 75% we achieved a more spacious and clearer webpage.</p>
            <h2>Nav bar</h2>
            <p>A lot of changes were made to the navbar. Not to the original design but how it functions. Because of the relatively few pages you will have to access we felt it would be easier to keep the design as is on mobile pages as well and not make a dropdown but instead show all the different pages you can access in the navbar right away. </p>
            <h2>Footer</h2>
            <p>The footer contains more info than was displayed in the mockup. We also wanted to display the sponsors in the footer as well as we imagine that's what an actual sponsor for a small football club would have wanted. We also looked at other small websites to see they had sponsors in their footer. More contact info was also put in the footer and links to various social media sites related to NTNU as there were none directly related to Webtek.</p>
            <h2>Index page</h2>
            <p>The index page changed a little from the original mockup. The first is the width of the slideshow which now takes up the whole width of the screen. After testing we saw that it looked a lot better to have a big welcoming image on the front page and made the slideshow that welcoming image. The slides now also switch automatically instead of having to push a button. The other change is the placement of the sponsors. Originally they were supposed to go on the bottom of the page. Now they are to the side on a big screen and above the text, right under the slideshow when the screen is smaller.</p>
            <h2>Changes to calendar.html</h2>
            <p>We changed the position of the paragraph to be above the calendar list instead of underas we saw that new users might not see or be aware of the information about the football field because it was hidden under the upcoming matches. Now you can see information about the field and you also see the start of the list of upcoming matches.</p>
            <h2>Calendar and results lists</h2>
            <p>We did not specify how we were going to display this on the page in P2 but the initial idea was to just write it out in plain HTML. As we did this we saw how confusing and untidy it was to both edit and list new results. And for someone to maintain and update the list it would take a lot longer to do this in HTML than with a tidy and clean list in Javascript. So instead of focusing on a dropdown for the nav we prioritized structuring and displaying results and upcoming matches in Javascript, as the navbar as previously mentioned was fine for the end user on mobile we believe, while maintaining the lists were difficult and cumbersome.</p>
            <h2>File names</h2>
            <p>Lastly some filenames changes in the image folder and some features like darkmode or prize wheel were incorporated into one single js file together with the navbar and footer since they were going to be accessible on every page.</p>
