            <ol>
                <li>Main page</li>
                <li>About</li>
                <li>News</li>
                <li>Join the club/membership</li>
                <li>Upcoming matches/ Calender</li>

            </ol>
            <p>The navigation structure of Webtek FC’s website can be seen as clique. This is shown in the figure below. The homepage (or index.html) 
                will be the first page that the users see. From here you can access any of the other webpages. When the user is using the website from a 
                desktop every page will be accessible from all the pages, through the navbar. When the user is using the website from a smaller device 
                (i.e a mobile) then we will make it as a rollover menu, but all the sites will be accessible from this rollover menu. 
            </p>
            <p>The reason we structure it in this way is because it makes it easy for the users to navigate through the webpage. It gives the user a 
                sense of the structure of the webpage. In this way it is much easier for the user to see all the pages and not having to dig through 
                other pages to get to a specific page. For example the user can access the calendar page directly from any other page. If you could 
                only access the calendar page through for instance news, then the user might not even see that the calendar page exists. Therefore it 
                is easier for the people interacting with the site, if the pages are accessible on every other page.

            <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>When coming up with the main design, we tried to keep the page clean and simple. We do not want the user to be bombarded with pictures, 
                links, and multiple paragraphs of text. The navigation bar has enough information to give the user the necessary tools to figure out 
                information about Webtek FC. The target audience will instantly know what link to click to figure out the information they need. The 
                layout includes WebTek FC`s logo, which is easily identifiable in the top left corner. The about page will be helpful for users that 
                want to learn more about WebTek FC, the membership page for users that are looking to join, the news page for anyone that wants to be 
                updated, and the results page for supporters and members. We reckon this universal design will be easy to use and meet the requirements of our users.

            <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Night mode</h3>
            <p>Since users might use our site during night or at a dark place, we want to give the possibility of changing the site into colors that are 
                more suitable for night. Therefore we plan to implement a javascript that allows the site's change into darker colors, for example the 
                background will be much darker than the standard version. This will make the site less bright during night or evening so you don't have 
                to manually change brightness on your device.
            </p>
            <h3>Button to win prices</h3>
            <p>We want to give our users some kind of interactions, therefore we want to implement a javascript that makes a spinning wheel. It will allow 
                users to have a chance of winning some kind of club’s merchandise. This will make users feel rewarded when they enter our site. Each user 
                will have a chance 1 time each week. Therefore if he/she want to win a prize, they have to check our site at least once a week.
            </p>
            <h3>Slideshow of images</h3>
            <p>A javascript that shows a slide of images from different events or matches, once the slideshow is over, it will loop back to beginning and start over. 
                We want our site to be appealing and share memories from different events. This will happen on our homepage once you enter our site, this is going to be 
                one of the first things you will see. It will allow every user to see what our club has done so far.
            </p>
            <h3>Rollover menu for mobile device</h3>
            <p>A javascript that allows mobile devices to have a rollover menu. Once you enter a site we don’t want users to have to scroll all the way back to the top 
                of the page to check other content. We also don’t want every link to constantly appear on the page, therefore having a rollover menu is a good solution. 
                This will be provided on each page and allow for easy access to all pages.
