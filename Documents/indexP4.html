            <h2>Testing Document</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The testing document contains of 11 questions. These are quite different questions and there are different ways to answer them.
    Some of the questions asks the user to write their thoughts about different things on the website. While other questions is to click on what they feel is correct. 
    The users will be given the url of the website and is told to go through the website before answering the questions. 
    The link to the forms is <a href="https://forms.gle/FuuRSxAiFLXfEeg27" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Our team has made a google form sheet which will be sent out to some people around Norway. Most of participants are students and in their (20s) This will be around 70% of the participants. 
    While the rest of the participants where in their 30+, even one at 55 (which makes up the last 30%). From these, we got to watch around 10 participants live. 
    The dominant age group of the participants are a good fit, since many of the players in the team are around that age.</p>

            <hr>
            <p> Most of the participants, will be using the computer (This is the participants that will be taking the survey without us present.). But for the 10 live participants,
    will there be 3 taking it on the phone (all of them are apple products, so it will be Safari), 3 on a tablet (also safari), and 4 on the computer(all on chrome). </p>

            <h2>Your Response</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Overall we did not get a whole lot of responses but the ones we got highlighted some important issues and were great feedback.</p>
            <p>
                In response to the feedback about the buttons we see that the buttons don't always stand out too well as buttons. We see that the idea of making the mouse turn into a pointer when hovering over would be a lot more user friendly and intriguing. <br>
                Also the buttons on the forms on the membership page are kind of hard to make out as they have the same design as the rest of the buttons on the web page and blend in with the background. This bad design choice was probably overlooked but to improve it we would make the button a different style with some sharper outlines and a different background color
                Another idea to make the buttons stand out more, as this was the biggest complaint in our testing group, would be to change the background color on hover as to signal that this is something you can interact with.
            </p>
            <p>
                One complaint was that the font on the paragraphs was boring. A way to solve this would be to do another test where we present different fonts to a small focus group to see what they like best. If that was not an option we could alternatively make a button so you could switch between two fonts, one being a simple one and another one being a little more exciting. altho it's not a big issue it could be cool seeing as we already have an option to change the color of the webpage.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the complaint to the darkmode, we do see that we could have chosen a bit of a blacker or darker blue. In addition we could also have chosen a dimmer white for the text as at the moment it stands out way more than it needs to to be seen and red. An alternative here could also have been to get a focus group to test darker color pallets.

            <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>This project assignment made us learn a lot.
                We learned that working on a project at this scale is a lot more challenging than just working together on an essay. 
                A project at this scale required a lot of planning, management, and communication. 
                All the while trying to learn the curriculum at the same time. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We also learned that coding together lets you tackle more challenging issues than one could do on their own. Through cooperation, 
                we gave each other feedback, solved demanding programming issues, and implemented improved ideas based on each other’s ideas. 
                Our experience is that the learning process is better through a group project than from a project on your own. </p>
              <br>
            <p>We also gained a newfound respect for front-end developers. 
                None of us realized the amount of work necessary to create a fully working website. 
                Coding a responsive website is much more time-consuming than we initially thought.
                Even a minor feature like adding dark mode could take hours instead of minutes. 
                We can not even begin to imagine the amount of code needed to create a website like Facebook or LinkedIn.
