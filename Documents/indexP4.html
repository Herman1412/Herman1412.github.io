            <p>The testing document contains of 11 questions. These are quite different questions and there are different ways to answer them.

            <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Our team has made a google form sheet which will be sent out to some people around Norway. Most of participants are students and in their (20s) This will be around 70% of the participants. 
    While the rest of the participants where in their 30+, even one at 55 (which makes up the last 30%). From these, we got to watch around 10 participants live. 
    The dominant age group of the participants are a good fit, since many of the players in the team are around that age.</p>

            <hr>
            <p> Most of the participants, will be using the computer (This is the participants that will be taking the survey without us present.). But for the 10 live participants,
    will there be 3 taking it on the phone (all of them are apple products, so it will be Safari), 3 on a tablet (also safari), and 4 on the computer(all on chrome). </p>

            <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>This project assignment made us learn a lot.
                We learned that working on a project at this scale is a lot more challenging than just working together on an essay. 
                A project at this scale required a lot of planning, management, and communication. 
                All the while trying to learn the curriculum at the same time. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We also learned that coding together lets you tackle more challenging issues than one could do on their own. Through cooperation, 
                we gave each other feedback, solved demanding programming issues, and implemented improved ideas based on each other’s ideas. 
                Our experience is that the learning process is better through a group project than from a project on your own. </p>
              <br>
            <p>We also gained a newfound respect for front-end developers. 
                None of us realized the amount of work necessary to create a fully working website. 
                Coding a responsive website is much more time-consuming than we initially thought.
                Even a minor feature like adding dark mode could take hours instead of minutes. 
                We can not even begin to imagine the amount of code needed to create a website like Facebook or LinkedIn.
