            <hr>
            <p>We choose an imaginary client. Our client is a small football team that wants more 
                members. The team is called Webtek FC and is located in Trondheim.

            <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The main purpose with the site is to spread awareness about the football club to the 
                people in Trondheim, since it is where the club is located. The club is fairly new 
                and needs a website such that people can learn about it. It is important to make sure 
                that the reader knows that it is meant for both kids, teenagers and adults. This will 
                be done by using the bold element such that it will be easy to see it. It is free to 
                join Webtek FC, hence one of the club’s wishes to have more coaches that can help. We 
                want to make a separate page for this such that the coaches that wish to help can read 
                more about it there. To attract more players the club wants to have a spinning wheel 
                on the website so that visitors of the site have a chance to win prizes, such as water 
                bottles, shoes, t-shirts etc. And lastly the website needs a page where you can read what 
                players who have already been there have said about the club, together with FAQ. 
                Thus our overall goal will be to create such a website where all these demands will be met, 
                and where the average user can easily navigate through the website.
